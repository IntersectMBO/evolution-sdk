## SignBuilderImpl overview

SignBuilder Implementation

Handles transaction signing by delegating to the wallet's signTx Effect method.
The SignBuilder is responsible for:

1. Providing the transaction and UTxO context to the wallet
2. Managing the transition from unsigned to signed transaction
3. Creating the SubmitBuilder for transaction submission

The actual signing logic (determining required signers, creating witnesses)
is the wallet's responsibility.
