# Evolution SDK

A comprehensive TypeScript SDK for Cardano blockchain development, built with Effect-TS.

## Overview

Evolution SDK provides a type-safe, functional programming approach to Cardano blockchain development. Built on top of Effect-TS, it offers:

- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with comprehensive type definitions
- **CBOR Support**: Native CBOR encoding/decoding for Cardano data structures
- **Effect Integration**: Leverages Effect-TS for error handling and composability
- **Address Management**: Support for all Cardano address types
- **Transaction Building**: Tools for constructing and signing transactions
- **Plutus Data**: Native support for Plutus data structures

## Quick Start

```bash
npm install @evolution-sdk/evolution
```

```typescript
import { Address, Network } from "@evolution-sdk/evolution"

// Create a base address
const baseAddr = Address.Base.make({
  network: Network.Mainnet,
  paymentCredential: paymentCred,
  stakeCredential: stakeCred
})
```

## Features

- 🏗️ **Address Utilities** - Create and validate all Cardano address types
- 🔐 **Cryptographic Primitives** - Ed25519 signatures, VRF, KES
- 📦 **CBOR Encoding** - RFC 8949 compliant CBOR implementation
- 🏛️ **Governance** - DRep, committee, and voting procedure support
- 🌐 **Network Configuration** - Support for all Cardano networks
- 🪙 **Native Tokens** - Multi-asset and minting utilities

## Architecture

Evolution SDK is designed around functional programming principles:

- **Immutable Data Structures** - All data types are immutable by default
- **Composable Operations** - Functions can be easily composed and chained
- **Error Handling** - Leverages Effect-TS for robust error management
- **Type Safety** - Comprehensive TypeScript definitions prevent runtime errors
